# MinimaxTicTacToe
This program allows users to play a Tic Tac Toe game against the 'computer' using a minimax algorithm. 
A few things that helped make my Minimax board game were the Grokking code provided to me by my professor and several different YouTube videos.

While this video didn't help me in making the game, it provided an excellent concept starting point for me that allowed me to better understand minimax conceptually.
